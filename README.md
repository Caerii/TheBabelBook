# TheBabelBook
The Library of Babel, now with GPT-3!

# Purpose
The purpose of this web application is to allow for the creation of a user-defined book of any kind.
It utilizes GPT-3 to generate subheadings for a book, which can be infinitely nested.

# How it works
The user is first asked to provide a book title, and a book description.
GPT-3 will generate subheadings for the book, and you can click on any of the subheadings, to either expand more subheadings for that chapter, or to have GPT-3 start writing things for that chapter. You can also provide a description for the
This allows you to explore infinitely nested ideas inside of the book, depending on what you find interesting.

# Purpose & Motivation
I think getting people to play around with the power of language models offers a lot for our creativity, and I think it would be fun to make it easy to play with. I personally read a lot of books, and the concept of a generative book is a fascinating concept that we are now capable of creating. I think co-creating is a better term though, and I think it will lead to new kinds of content creation.

# Use Cases
This can be used to make creative artifacts for *worldbuilding*, as the book can be a kind of lore that is explored.
It can also be used to learn about new topics, although, with a grain of salt as GPT-3 should not be believed.
It's also an *experimental tool* to *ideate* on concepts.

# Share!
Users can share their books with their others with an export function (in Markdown, or plain text).
They can also share the links with their friends in order for iteration.
